----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line indicating with different 
# fields when the task will be run and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for minute (m), hour (h), day of 
# month (dom), month (mon), and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 
# 'any').
# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system daemon's notion of time 
# and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through email to the user the 
# crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts at 5 a.m every week with: 
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h dom mon dow command
